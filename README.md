# Notes

## Motivation
During work and study, we usually create some functions or plots. This repo is meant to archrive those functions and plots, so that when next time a similar object is needed, they can be deployed directly.


## Data
Data used here are numbers generated and transformed using Python Numpy and Pandas packages.
